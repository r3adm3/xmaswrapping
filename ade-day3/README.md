## First Problem: Calculate extra hours
Mrs Claus suspects that the elves are missing working days through the year. 
She wants to make sure Santa is supported for the particularly busy time of the 
year by making sure that if a working day (Mon-Fri) is missed that the elves have 
to work back two hours per days missed. She'd like a program to work this out for her 
(and wants to make sure this is transparent to all of the elves including all 
of the changes happening to that programming)

So given a year and an array of holiday dates, the program has to output how many extra hours the elf would have to work

github repo is here: https://github.com/r3adm3/xmaswrapping.git\

This means branches and PRs in Mrs Claus's repo (ie. mine)

## Second Problem: Santa wants a karaoke machine
His favorite song is Twelve Days of Christmas
His computer is really old and doesn't have much space for computer programs
Write a script that can show the lyrics of the twelve days of Christmas, without actually writing the whole song out by hand.
and if you can sneak an emoji in there too, that'd be lovely.

Santa doesn't want to lose the code, but doesn't need it in Santa Inc's code repo (so put it in your own repos)
